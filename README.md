# odin-recipes

- This repo is for a personal project named recipes.
- In this project I built a static website with multiple pages describing my favorite recipes.
- I used various HTML elements and CSS selectors to build this website.
- I learned that we can center align any type of content on screen using CSS property value pairs:
  ```CSS
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  ```
- I also learned a way to keep the footer of a webpage at the bottom using CSS flexbox property. (Link to webpage showing this: [Footer at bottom](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-keep-your-footer-at-the-bottom-of-the-page-the-easy-way-20aa3bcd621f))
